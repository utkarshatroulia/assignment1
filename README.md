# assignment1
Here I have used python programming to perform 2 task. First is to perform basic mathematical function and second is to create personalized greeting

# Task 1 - Perform basic mathematical operations

INPUT-
a= float(input('Enter the first number:'))
b = float(input('Enter the second number:'))

print('addition:', a+b)
print('Subraction:', a-b)
print('Multiplication:', a*b)
print('Division:', a/b)

Here i have taken a in which i have use float which represent that i can take any number of any form such as decimal form or normal form.In first line 
i have given input as ENTER THE FIRST NUMBER. here you have to put any number. then in second line you have to put the second number of your choice. 
then after that we have done addition, subraction, multiplication and division 

OUTPUT - 

Enter the first number:10
Enter the second number:20
addition: 30.0
Subraction: -10.0
Multiplication: 200.0
Division: 0.5

Process finished with exit code 0

Here i have taken first number as 10 and second number as 20. So, after that we have got the answer accordingly by addition, subraction, division and multiplication.

# Task 2 - Create a Personalized Greeting 

INPUT - 
name1 = input('Enter a first name: ')
name2 = input('Enter a second name:')

fullname = name1+ '' +name2
print('Hello,' ,fullname + '! Welcome to the python program')

here i have give 2 names and i have added those two names to give 1 name which is the full name. then 
i have printed Hello, fullname! Welcome to the python program. Which is done successfully. Here is the Output 

OUTPUT - 
Enter a first name: Utkarsh 
Enter a second name:Atroulia
Hello, Utkrarsh Atroulia! Welcome to the python program

Process finished with exit code 0

here i have entered the first name as Utkarsh And second name as Atroulia. So, We have got the sentence with adding Utkarsh And Atroulia. Here we go Hello, Utkrarsh Atroulia! Welcome to the python program.
